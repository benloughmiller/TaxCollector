# Overview

This software is a digital version of the 'Tax Collector' math game that is used in some middle and high schools to teach students factors and logic. 

The Tax Collector game has traditionally been played using a paper and pencil. This program reduces paper waste for teachers by recreating the game in a digital format. 

The rules of the game are as follows:
    1. Each turn, you pick a number from 1 and a number of your choice.
    2. You gain points equal to the number you pick.
    3. The tax collector gains points equal to the factors of the picked number that are still available.
    4. The selected number and its factors are removed from the game.
    5. If a number has no remaining factors, its point value is given to the tax collector and is removed from the game.
    6. The game ends when all numbers have been picked or removed.
    7. Whoever has the highest score at the end wins.
